      <p>Hello Mahal, Happy Monthsary!
Thank you for all the effort you've put in this past year and for the love you always give. Despite all the challenges youâ€™ve faced, I believe you are still the perfect girl for me because you're strong enough to handle everything, even though these problems have made your mental health more vulnerable. I will always believe in you because you have the strength to overcome them. Stay strong as always, and never give up on your dreams. I love you so much, and I will always be here for you. Mwah! ðŸ˜˜
